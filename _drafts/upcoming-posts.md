- What makes a good prototype. Learning, building confidence, having fun.
- Journal about the first tasks I've been tackling and what I'm learning from them.

Some other future posts:
- Thoughts on games as a medium, and how weird game dev becomes as a hobby.
- The dichotomy between "hobby" and "technically if I do this right I could make a million dollars".
- The way that finding someone to do this with becomes difficult because of that.
- Using AI in the hobby space, and the difficulty there.
