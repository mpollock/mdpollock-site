I want to make games. How do I do that? What's the end goal? Let's find out.

## Goals

Goals are important. I think.

Generally, I'm just doing this as a hobby. I have been coding professionally for almost a decade and it's fine. It pays the bills and there's not much I'd rather do full time. But I find that getting to build games, show off a product, and explore new technology is way more exciting to me. So goal number one, have fun.

I think it would be awesome to publish something on to Steam. Obviously I can publish anything I want and call this goal done, but we'll get there. So goal number two, publish something to Steam.

I would love to have people enjoy my game as well! I want to make a game, yes, but even more I want to make a *good* game, and how am I supposed to know it's good if my mom doesn't tell me it is? But she doesn't play games, so someone else's mom will have to pick up the slack. So goal number three, sell the game to at least 100 ~~moms~~ people.

That's it! Simple enough:

1. Make sure it's fun
2. Publish something to Steam, eventually
3. Get some eyeballs on it

## Getting There

Obviously much easier than it sounds. There are going to be a ton of stepping stones and baby steps as we move in that direction. Broadly, though, the plan is to dabble with some fun little prototypes in Godot. I think making somewhere between six to eight of these in different genres, with different systems, will help build my confidence and teach me what I don't know.

I'm already learning that the vast majority of my time will be focused on content, not on the engine itself. I'll dive into that in a future post.
