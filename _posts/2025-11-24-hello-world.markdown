# Hi, I'm Michael!

Obviously, this is my first post. Feel free to ignore it.

My plans for the blog, broadly, are to have a place to journal about what I'm doing and learning in the game dev space.

More specifically, I want the next few posts to be:
- Introduction. Where I'm coming from. This one will be broadly ignorable, probably.
- Plan for where I want to go, what I want to learn, and broad goals.
- Journal about the first tasks I've been tackling and what I'm learning from them.

Some other future posts:
- Thoughts on games as a medium, and how weird it becomes as a hobby.
- The dichotomy between "hobby" and "technically if I do this right I could make a million dollars".
- The way that finding someone to do this with becomes difficult because of that.
- Using AI in the hobby space, and the difficulty there.
